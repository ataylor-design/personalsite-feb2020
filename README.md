# personal - css review
CSS code and resources for my personal site. Modified to sample text & images, and simple scripting for easier review for those unfamilliar with PHP, as my live website uses a lot of PHP scripting. Night mode and copyright years will not work without the website being on a host or otherwise being able to use PHP functionality; please keep this in mind when reviewing the site.

This repository does not include code or functionality for IMG_VIEWER.
